Back in October (October 25th) to be more exact; I left my old company for VMware. Not that my previous employer wasn't a good place to work I had just outgrown them and needed a new greener pasture to continue growing professionally.  
  
My new role at VMware is as a Sr. Consultant with the vCloud Services Team. What does that mean exactly? In a nutshell I will be helping VMware customers plan, develop and deploy their own Private, Hybrid and/or Public Clouds.  
  
I have not been posting to my blog as often as I desired or want to be able to do, due to the new job and learning my new role. Hopefully in the next few weeks you will see new posts and new items coming from me and possibly other posters in this space.
