Can vCloud Director be installed with ESXi in lockdown mode?  
  
The short answer is 'No'... Â But the longer answer is 'Yes'.  
  
To allow the vCloud agents to be installed on the ESXi host, lock down mode has to be disabled; BUT after the vCloud agents are installed feel free to lock it down again.  
  
See with vCloud all answers have a but. :-)
