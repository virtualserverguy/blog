With the New Year brings some new changes; I am transferring inside of VMware to a new group that is focusing on Cloud Consumption.

Cloud Consumption... WTH is that?

For the past, well as long as I have been in IT, I have been doing 'Ping, Power and Pipe'. With IaaS it is in my opinion it has been done, most any experienced IT person could stand up IaaS.

In my new role I will be focusing on methods to consume the cloud offerings. For example, how does one define a service (in the ITIL sense) from this 'Ping, Power, and Pipe'? Another example, what requirements does a consumer have? How can the cloud offering satisfy those requirements?

More importantly... "Define the services that consumers will utilize, while driving the architecture of the physical"

Happy New Years! 2013 will most definitely be a challenging year.
