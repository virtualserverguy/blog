You can disable (well limit) the ad tracking that is done in iOS 6. This setting turns off the ability for advertisers to use what is called the 'Advertising Identifier'. This replaces the devices UUID which is a non-anonymous way of tracking usage. The advertising identifier is 'anonymous' (though further research needs to be done).

Here is how to disable the ability for advertisers to track you at all (once they move from the old deprecated UUID model).

1. Fire up your iOS device
2. Under Settings
3. Find General
4. Click on About
5. Scroll to the bottom and select 'Advertising'
6. Set the 'Limit Ad Tracking' to 'On'

You are done. Now go forth, untracked from iOS ads (the Apple ones anyway).
