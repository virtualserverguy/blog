I came back from a good lunch with HP talking about the G7 servers that should be released any month now to find:  

Congratulations!  You have achieved the VMware Certified Design Expert on VI3 (VCDX3) certification.

  

Your VCDX number is: VCDX51

  
After I stopped jumping up and down cheering and causing quite a scare, I was able to really grasp what this means.  
  
I would like to thank everyone that has helped me along with this certification, from my manager to my former supervisor and of course previous employers that allowed me to experiment with VMware while saving them vast sums of money in hardware.  And of course to my loving wife, who I am sure will be happy to get her husband back after nearly two weeks of laying awake at night waiting for this news.  
  
So what does it mean to my current job and career?  
  
Well besides being the hardest to obtain and biggest achievement that I have ever received it helps to validate to myself that I do know what I am talking about.  It also helps to validate that the server rack of hardware at home is actually being used and helping me to justify its cost (well to the wife anyway).  
  
Other than that, we will have to see what it means.  
  
For now, thank you all.  And CONGRATULATIONS to all my fellow VCDX's!
