      <description>As a system or organization administrator head to the &amp;lsquo;Administration&amp;rsquo; page, and then the federation tab. Paste or upload the SAML configuration XML. Ensure the certificate at the bottom of the page is recent, if not click re-generate certificate. It will produce a certificate for 1 year.
After the certificate is re-newed enter this URL in to the web browser: cloud/org/\[orgName\]/saml/metadata/alias/vcd ; save the XML file on that page. This is the file you will need to provide the SAML or 3rd party authentication service with in order to authenticate you.</description>

      <description>You can disable (well limit) the ad tracking that is done in iOS 6. This setting turns off the ability for advertisers to use what is called the &amp;lsquo;Advertising Identifier&amp;rsquo;. This replaces the devices UUID which is a non-anonymous way of tracking usage. The advertising identifier is &amp;lsquo;anonymous&amp;rsquo; (though further research needs to be done).
Here is how to disable the ability for advertisers to track you at all (once they move from the old deprecated UUID model).</description>
