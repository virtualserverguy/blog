      <description>The vCenter Server Appliance comes with a built-in DB2 database for use as an all-in-one solution for small lab environments. The sizing is supposed to be less than 5 hosts and 50 VMs. But it can work much higher than that if given enough resources, :-).
One issue that occurs when using this appliance is that the DB2 log settings are too small for any extended operation. This is due to stat roll-up jobs taking more log space to complete than the DB2 instanace is set for.</description>
