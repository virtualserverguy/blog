      <description>I was asked recently on my opinion on nesting resource pools with VMs inter-mixed, well what should you do?
Well here is an easy example; if I have a Resource Pool with 9 VMs and 1 nested Resource Pool, what level of resources are each given? 10% each.
Think about that, each of the VMs have 10% of the resources and the ENTIRE nested Resource Pool has 10% of the resources.</description>
