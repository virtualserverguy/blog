      <description>The vCenter Server Appliance comes with a built-in DB2 database for use as an all-in-one solution for small lab environments. The sizing is supposed to be less than 5 hosts and 50 VMs. But it can work much higher than that if given enough resources, :-).
One issue that occurs when using this appliance is that the DB2 log settings are too small for any extended operation. This is due to stat roll-up jobs taking more log space to complete than the DB2 instanace is set for.</description>

      <description>In order to remove the vCloud agents from vSphere 5 hosts you need to execute the following command on the console:
 esxcli software vib remove –n vcloud-agent
 This can be ran by the PowerCLI or the vSphereCLI or on the SSH console with tech support mode enabled.
Reboot the hosts after this step to complete the removal.</description>
