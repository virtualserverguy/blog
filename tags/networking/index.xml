      <description>What the heck is Network as a Service (NaaS)?
Wait I know&amp;hellip; it is one of those catchy new jargons that the marketing people use.
Actually, they will; someday.
Right now though I am referring to the idea that what was done for compute, virtualization, can be done for networking. Think quickly of how networking is tied to the physical.
If you want to add a new server to your datacenter&amp;hellip; You have to rack it, power it, and connect it to the physical network.</description>
