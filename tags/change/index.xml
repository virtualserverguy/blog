      <description>I started working at VMware just under two years ago. In that time I have gone for a Cloud Practice, where we developed the services and solutions that are being implemented today. Which transitioned into a group developing bleeding edge documentation, processes, and ultimately &amp;lsquo;making the marketing world a reality&amp;rsquo;.
Since then I have transitioned to a more security in the cloud role. For example, how can a workload in the cloud be secured and audited against, no matter where it is running?</description>
