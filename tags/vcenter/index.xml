      <description>vCM or vCenter Configuration Manager 5.5 was released in March by VMware with a few new features. First of all and the topic of this blog post, is the re-inclusion of a split install. Split install being the database, application and web page can be on different servers.You ask didn&amp;rsquo;t vCM or SCM or ECM (depending on when you used vCM last) have this feature before? It did back in the 5.</description>

      <description>The vCenter Server Appliance comes with a built-in DB2 database for use as an all-in-one solution for small lab environments. The sizing is supposed to be less than 5 hosts and 50 VMs. But it can work much higher than that if given enough resources, :-).
One issue that occurs when using this appliance is that the DB2 log settings are too small for any extended operation. This is due to stat roll-up jobs taking more log space to complete than the DB2 instanace is set for.</description>

      <title>Error in vCenter when creating a PvDC in vCloud Director</title>

      <description>If your vCloud Director machine is on the same vCenter as the Compute Clusters are (not a best practice but it does work), you can not have the same vCloud Director machine name in vCenter as you named the vCloud installation during installation.
This will produce an error such as “The already exists.”
This is because vCenter Folders and Virtual Machines can not have identical names. Can the host name be the same?</description>
