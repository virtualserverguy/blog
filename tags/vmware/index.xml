      <description>When VMware released the vRam pricing models and limits last week there was quite an uproar over the limitations being set to low. It appears that VMware was listening and has responded with a hefty increase in vRam allocations.
That is nearly double the entitlements.
Also changing is how the usage is calculated for a high water mark (think bursting for a day) to a rolling 12 month average!
Finally the last news and some major news at that, is that a single VM can only consume 96GB of vRam, no matter how you set the VM up!</description>
