      <description>Even when using vC Ops from VMware, vCenter metrics, vCloud Metrics, and Hyperic Montoring there are things that can be missed.
What if the datastore shows 1ms latency on the vSphere host, the CPU usage is low, the Memory is not being swapped, but a user insists it is just &amp;lsquo;slow&amp;rsquo;. What would you check?
In our cloud deployment (25,000 VMs in a single vCloud instance, and we have 4); I have deployed 4 - 6 VMs per vCenter across differnet datastores, on different hosts.</description>
