      <description>With the New Year brings some new changes; I am transferring inside of VMware to a new group that is focusing on Cloud Consumption.
Cloud Consumption&amp;hellip; WTH is that?
For the past, well as long as I have been in IT, I have been doing &amp;lsquo;Ping, Power and Pipe&amp;rsquo;. With IaaS it is in my opinion it has been done, most any experienced IT person could stand up IaaS.
In my new role I will be focusing on methods to consume the cloud offerings.</description>
