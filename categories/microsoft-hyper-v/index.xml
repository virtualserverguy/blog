      <description>Recently I have seen quite a bit of question and discussion of how vSphere handles disk writes from the guest OS and performance questions about limiting the writes.
The question started off innocently as &amp;ldquo;How can we gaurantee vSphere disk writes happen and are not cached?&amp;rdquo;
First lets analyze where this may have started SQL Solutions posted this article , in which they tested SQL server on a VMware virtual machine and tested the write caching of the DB and the virtual machine.</description>

      <description>ESX 3.0 thru ESX 4.0 limit the heap size for VMFS to 16MB which allows for just 4TB of VMFS files to be open at a time. Once this threshold is crossed the ESX host start to behave eradically, possible crashing the VMs that were powered on at the time. To avoid this problem you can increase the heap size to 128MB which will allow for 32TB of storage open on a single ESX host.</description>
