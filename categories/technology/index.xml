      <description>With the New Year brings some new changes; I am transferring inside of VMware to a new group that is focusing on Cloud Consumption.
Cloud Consumption&amp;hellip; WTH is that?
For the past, well as long as I have been in IT, I have been doing &amp;lsquo;Ping, Power and Pipe&amp;rsquo;. With IaaS it is in my opinion it has been done, most any experienced IT person could stand up IaaS.
In my new role I will be focusing on methods to consume the cloud offerings.</description>

      <description>Here are the programs and things that I need on a daily business to get my job done.
1. Instapaper - While reading blogs, security news and other information; I log the pages to instapaper.
2. Evernote - I have an AppleScript that takes items from Instapaper and places them into Evernote for later retrieval. I also use Evernote to keep wikis and other documents for easy search and access.</description>

      <description>I recently moved from Sugar Sync with over 60GB stored to SpiderOak for cloud based storage of documents, pictures and other data. Before I explain why here is a quick overview on how they work differently (based on the documentation on their web sites).
SugarSync Data is transmitted unencrypted to SugarSync through a encrypted SSL/TLS connection to the SugarSync servers. The data is then encrypted and stored on the SugarSync servers for later retrieval.</description>
